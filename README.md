# Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit

## Overview
Deadlocks occur when multiple processes in an operating system are stuck waiting for resources held by other processes, resulting in circular waiting conditions. This inefficiency can lead to resource starvation, reduced system performance, and even total system failure.

## Purpose
The **Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit** provides real-time detection, prevention, and recovery solutions to ensure smooth system operation by:
- **Detecting Deadlocks:** Identifying deadlocks using cycle detection techniques and the Resource Allocation Graph (RAG).
- **Preventing Deadlocks:** Utilizing Banker's Algorithm and other safe resource allocation strategies.
- **Recovering from Deadlocks:** Resolving deadlocks through resource pre-emption or process termination.
- **Simulation & Visualization:** Offering a dynamic view of resource allocation and deadlock scenarios.

## Algorithms Implemented
The toolkit incorporates the following key algorithms:

### 1. **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)**
   - A directed graph that represents resources and processes, used to detect potential circular waits.

### 2. **Cycle Detection Algorithm**
   - Identifies deadlocks by finding cycles within the Resource Allocation Graph.

### 3. **Banker’s Algorithm**
   - A safety algorithm that ensures resource requests are only granted if they do not lead to a deadlock.

### 4. **Pre-emptive Techniques**
   - Implements controlled resource allocation and prioritization to minimize deadlock risks.

## Recovery Mechanisms
If a deadlock occurs, the toolkit provides the following recovery mechanisms:

### 1. **Process Termination**
   - Resolves deadlocks by terminating one or more processes involved in the deadlock cycle.

### 2. **Resource Pre-emption**
   - Forces processes to release resources, allowing reallocation to break the deadlock.

By integrating these techniques, the **Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit** offers a comprehensive approach to handling deadlocks efficiently in operating systems.

# Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit

This repository provides a structured approach to detecting, preventing, and recovering from deadlocks in real-time systems. The toolkit is divided into several modules for better organization and development.

## Module-Wise Breakdown

### 1. Deadlock Detection Module
- **Purpose:** Detects deadlocks using a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG).
- **Implementation:**
  - Construct a graph representation of resource allocation.
  - Apply cycle detection algorithms (DFS-based) to identify circular waits.
  - If a cycle is found, a deadlock is detected.
- **Output:** Displays whether a deadlock is present or not.

### 2. Deadlock Prevention Module
- **Purpose:** Prevents deadlocks by ensuring the system never enters an unsafe state.
- **Implementation:**
  - Implement Banker’s Algorithm to check safe states before resource allocation.
  - Use pre-emptive techniques, such as ordering resource requests and checking availability before granting them.
- **Output:** Ensures that resources are allocated only if they result in a safe system state.

### 3. Deadlock Recovery Module
- **Goal:** Recovers from deadlocks as soon as they are identified.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Process Termination:** Breaks circular waits by selectively terminating processes.
  - **Resource Pre-emption:** Reallocates and temporarily recovers resources from specific processes.
- **Output:** Indicates which resources were pre-empted or which processes were stopped in order to break the deadlock.

### 4. Simulation Module
- **Purpose:** Enables users to design and test their own deadlock scenarios.
- **Implementation:**
  - Offers a user interface where users can input resource allocation scenarios.
  - Based on user-defined inputs, it simulates deadlock occurrence.
  - If a deadlock is found, a list of sequential recovery steps is displayed.
- **Output:** Visual indication of whether or not a particular situation results in a deadlock.

### 5. Visualization Module
- **Goal:** Offers a visual depiction of deadlock situations and resource distribution.
- **Implementation:**
  - Resource Allocation Graphs are dynamically generated using Graph Viz (C++) or Matplotlib (Python).
  - Safe and unsafe states are visually displayed.
- **Output:** A visual representation of processes, resources, allocations, and instances of deadlock.

### 6. User Interface (CLI/GUI)
- **Purpose:** Offers an interactive toolkit management interface.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** For users accustomed to text-based communication.
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI) (optional):** To make visual elements easier to use.
- **Output:** Enables convenient resource, process, and allocation data input.
