# Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit

## Overview
Deadlocks occur when multiple processes in an operating system are stuck waiting for resources held by other processes, resulting in circular waiting conditions. This inefficiency can lead to resource starvation, reduced system performance, and even total system failure.

## Purpose
The **Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit** provides real-time detection, prevention, and recovery solutions to ensure smooth system operation by:
- **Detecting Deadlocks:** Identifying deadlocks using cycle detection techniques and the Resource Allocation Graph (RAG).
- **Preventing Deadlocks:** Utilizing Banker's Algorithm and other safe resource allocation strategies.
- **Recovering from Deadlocks:** Resolving deadlocks through resource pre-emption or process termination.
- **Simulation & Visualization:** Offering a dynamic view of resource allocation and deadlock scenarios.

## Algorithms Implemented
The toolkit incorporates the following key algorithms:

### 1. **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)**
   - A directed graph that represents resources and processes, used to detect potential circular waits.

### 2. **Cycle Detection Algorithm**
   - Identifies deadlocks by finding cycles within the Resource Allocation Graph.

### 3. **Bankerâ€™s Algorithm**
   - A safety algorithm that ensures resource requests are only granted if they do not lead to a deadlock.

### 4. **Pre-emptive Techniques**
   - Implements controlled resource allocation and prioritization to minimize deadlock risks.

## Recovery Mechanisms
If a deadlock occurs, the toolkit provides the following recovery mechanisms:

### 1. **Process Termination**
   - Resolves deadlocks by terminating one or more processes involved in the deadlock cycle.

### 2. **Resource Pre-emption**
   - Forces processes to release resources, allowing reallocation to break the deadlock.

By integrating these techniques, the **Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit** offers a comprehensive approach to handling deadlocks efficiently in operating systems.
